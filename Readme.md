# Canonical Shape Projection is All You Need for 3D Few-shot Class Incremental Learning

## Introduction
This repository contains the implementation for the paper titled "Canonical Shape Projection is All You Need for 3D Few-shot Class Incremental Learning". The goal of this project is to explore and implement the proposed method using Python and PyTorch.

## Requirements
- Python (>=3.6)
- PyTorch (>=1.0)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
   cd your_repository
   ```
   
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Training:**
   To train the model, run:
   ```
   python train.py --options
   ```
   Make sure to adjust the options and hyperparameters according to your setup.

2. **Evaluation:**
   To evaluate the trained model, run:
   ```
   python evaluate.py --options
   ```
   Provide the necessary options for evaluation, such as model checkpoint path, evaluation dataset, etc.
